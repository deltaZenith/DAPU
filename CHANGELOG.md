## Version 0.1.1
Added functionality that detects whether zypper is being used on OpenSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed, this enables DAPU to follow best pratices depending on the respective version.  
## Version 0.1
Added Zypper support.  
This version marks DAPU's entrance in the beta phase since all package managers that were planned to be included originally are now supported.  
This doesn't mean that other ones aren't going to be supported, so look forward to future versions of DAPU that are even more distro-agnostic and with more advanced features to satisfy both newcomers and more seasoned users.

## Version 0.0.2
Added simple logging capabilities and dnf support.
## Version 0.0.1
The very first version of DAPU to be released, it includes APT and pacman support and a simple user interface to make for an easy to use, lightweight, interactive script. Its functionalities include installation, removal, updating of packages, listing the installed packages, searching for a package in the distro's repos, cleaning the package manager's cache.
